                <p><div>The sneaker world has been tainted by resellers and robots who gain access to sneakers before the general public can get a chance to get our hands on them. Blessed Soles was created to give people a chance to own their favorite shoes for affordable prices and less hassle.

                            <div>The sneaker world has changed dramatically since the beginning of the resell era. Our favorite shoes have been more difficult to purchase and Blessed Soles is here to help. We are here to BLESS our users with their favorite shoes at reasonable prices. Resell prices knock up the retail price to 50% and often much higher. We want to BLESS our community with more affordable options.

                        <div>The user flow provided me the opportunity to review the details I wanted to include for my app. I wanted to make the navigation of the site easy and the product to stand out.

                    <p><div>The low fidelity frames were the iteration of my user flow. I was able to map out the flow of my app to confirm the seamless navigation and display of my product.</div></p>

                    <p><div>Producing the mid fidelity frames gave me the oppourtinty to finally see the app with color and the usage of imagery. It began to provide the app with feeling and emotion which is essential in UI Design.</div></p>

                <p>Once I finalized the style from my wireframes, I developed the finishing touches and created prototypes for each device which I had users test!</p>
