                                        <div><p>The Problem</p>
                                            <div>There are a number of apps for users to download if they want to gain access to the latest sports news and scores. However, there are no apps that are immediately available for use on the Apple or Android mobile devices. They have a calculator, weather, podcasts and even global news. What about the sports lovers?</div>
                                        <div><p>The Solution</p>
                                            <div>I have created an app called, Scoreboard. This will give the user instant access to sports on their mobile devices. They will be allowed to turn on the notifications for their favorites leagues, teams and players. Scoreboard will keep up with the latest scores, news and highlights. As a sports fan, the user will not miss out on any major sports events and outcomes.</div>

                                <div>The user flow was my first opportunity to establish the basis of what I wanted to include into the app. I was able to plan out what my users would want in a sports app. This also helped me gauge how quickly they would be able to get to their desired locations and accomplish their goals.

                            <p><div>Creating the sketches for the app is the first step of visual representation for what I wanted to create for my userâ€™s interaction with the app. I designed options for both iOS and Material.</div></p>
